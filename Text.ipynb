        "I. MOTIVATION AND SCOPE\n",
        "The global public health setting of the current century shows that obesity has replaced diseases that spread between individuals as the main form of spreading condition causing significant burden. The World Health Organization provides data that show the measure of body mass above the level considered optimal was the cause of approximately three point seven million deaths from conditions such as disease affecting the heart and vessels, disease affecting sugar control in the body, disease involving growth of cells in harmful ways, disease affecting the system controlling thought and movement, disease affecting breathing over time, and disease affecting the system that processes food. In the year two thousand twenty two, two point five billion individuals aged eighteen years and older showed measures above the optimal level, and this group included over eight hundred ninety million individuals who were living with the condition of obesity (World Health Organization, 2025).\n",
        "（World Health Organization - Global Health Observatory (2025) – processed by Our World in Data）\n",
        "\n",
        "This pattern does not appear in the same way across different areas but rather shows a clear divide in health equity across the world and lines of difference related to economic and social factors within countries. In this setting, the United States presents a clear case that holds significant value for research: this country functions as the largest developed economy in the world and leads in providing resources for research in the area of medicine, but the rate of obesity in individuals who have reached the age of being considered adults has remained at the top of the list when compared to other developed countries and shows patterns of continuing to increase. Data that the World Health Organization provides for all countries from 1990 through 2022 show that the rate of obesity in adults in the United States was above 40% in 2022. Motivation and Scope, and this represents a difference of ten percentage points when compared to the United Kingdom that holds the position of second place and shows a level significantly higher than other countries (Ritchie and Roser, 2024).\n",
        "\n",
        "The focus of this study is to place the case of the United States in a setting that allows comparison across the world and to examine the complex causes of the high rates through analysis using data at multiple levels. The range of this work focuses in a clear way on three levels of analysis that relate to each other: first, identifying the exceptional magnitude of the problem of obesity in the United States at the level of the world; second, examining patterns within the United States to find groups of states that show the highest burden of obesity; and third, and this represents the main focus of this study, examining in a critical way the main factors related to economic and social conditions and political systems that contribute to these differences between states. This approach to analysis recognises that obesity does not result simply from choices that individuals make but rather represents the product of choices made in policy, forces in the economic system, patterns that society considers normal, and the environment that has been constructed.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "II. RESEARCH QUESTIONS AND OBJECTIVES\n",
        "This study will then focus on patterns that appear in obesity rates across the United States, asks why the United States shows the highest obesity rate among developed economies and whether significant differences occur between states within the country. The analysis considers whether three main structural factors provide explanation for these differences. The selection of educational level, economic level, and political influence as the main indicators for analysis follows from theoretical and practical foundations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Educational attainment relates directly to health literacy. It also relates to how individuals perceive long-term health risks and their ability to access and interpret information about nutrition. Evidence confirms that education has a positive effect on obesity. Higher education tends to show association with lower BMI index values (Liu, Ji and Zhu, 2024). Populations with less education tend to encounter more exposure to marketing for unhealthy food. These populations also tend to live in areas that researchers describe as food deserts where healthy food choices show limited availability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Economic level provides a central factor that drives patterns in obesity. This includes income inequality, poverty rates, and food insecurity. Findings from CDC show that most obese adults are not low income(CDC, 2019). Processed foods that contain high calories and low nutrients often appear inexpensive and readily available. Fresh fruits and vegetables and other healthy foods show relative expense in comparison. Economic stress limits food choices available to individuals. This stress also shows association with chronic stress conditions that can disrupt metabolism and promote eating in response to emotional factors.\n",
        "\n",
        "Political influences shape the food environment directly through legislative and regulatory policies. The adoption or non-adoption of taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages provides a clear reflection of these influences. These decisions reflect the interaction between political ideologies, industry lobbying forces, and public health interests. A 20% tax on sugar sweetened drinks would lead to a reduction in the prevalence of obesity in the UK of 1.3%(Briggs et al., 2013).\n",
        "\n",
        "The policies affect prices and patterns for individuals directly and also indicate the role of intervention by government in this area, reveal inequalities in the distribution of resources and power and knowledge that relate to the problem of increasing rates of overweight conditions, and this provides an answer to the question of reasons that the United States requires separate analysis as a particular case.\n",

        "Data & Methodology\n",
        "Research design and analysis framework\n",
        "This project examines why the obesity rate in the United States remain high level around the world, and how this issue manifests across different U.S. states. Obesity is not a problem determined solely by individual behavior, but is closely related to the broader social, economic and policy contexts. Therefore, it is difficult to fully understand this phenomenon by relying only on single-level data.\n",
        "Based on this consideration, this study adopts the idea of multi-level analytical framework. The analysis starts from the global level to provide an international comparative background for the obesity problem in the United States; then turn to the United States to examine the spatial distribution differences in state-level obesity rates; finally, after identifying states with high obesity rates, introduce socioeconomic and political variables to further exploratory analysis of these states. This step-by-step progression from broad context to more focused analysis helps establish background before attempting explanation.\n",
        "Data source\n",
        "GLOBAL OBESITY DATA (DATA1):\n",
        "Global obesity data comes from Our World in Data, which integrates the statistical results of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Global Disease Burden Study (GBD) to provide national adult obesity rate data covering 1990-2022 (in BMI ≥ 30 is the standard for measurement).\n",
        " In this project, global data is mainly used for background comparison, not to analyze the specific trend of obesity rate over time. Through cross-border comparison, the position of the United States in the distribution of the international obesity rate can be intuitively judged, so as to confirm whether the United States has been at a high level in high-income countries for a long time. The purpose of this step of analysis is to provide a reasonable research background for the subsequent focus on domestic differences in the United States.\n",
        "\n",
        "U.S. state-level obesity data (DATA2):\n",
        "The state-level obesity rate data in the United States comes from the 2015 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This dataset provides standardised estimates of adult obesity prevalence at the state level and is widely used in research on regional health inequalities in the United States.\n",
        "In this project, the state-level obesity rate data is mainly used to show the differences between different states in the United States. By drawing a spatial distribution map of the state-level obesity rate, we can intuitively observe whether the obesity rate shows the characteristics of concentrated distribution in some areas. At the same time, state-level data is also used to sort, identify the five states with the highest obesity rate, and provide research subjects for further more targeted analysis.\n",
        " It should be noted that this part of the analysis is based on the cross-sectional data of 2015. Also the study focuses on the relative differences between interstates, not the trend of obesity rates over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Socioeconomic and political variables (DATA3):\n",
        "In the third phase of the analysis, the study focuses on the five states with the highest obesity rate. These aims to try to further understand why these states are particularly prominent in obesity. For this reason, this study introduces three types of explanatory variables: education level, economic status, and factors related to the political or policy environment.\n",
        "Education and economic indicators mainly come from the analytical data set released by County Health Rankings & Roadmaps (CHR). The data set provides a variety of socio-economic indicators at the county level, which is aggregated to state-level use in this study. The level of education is usually measured by indicators such as the proportion of higher education completion, which is used to reflect the differences in health perception and long-term health behavior of the population; the economic situation is measured by indicators such as the median family income to portray the overall economic level of the state. These two types of variables are often used in public health studies to explain the social context of chronic health problems.\n",
        " Political and policy environment variables are constructed based on the data of the U.S. county presidential election results (tonmcg, 2008-2024). Through the state-level aggregation of the county-level voting results of the 2020 presidential election, the study constructed a proxy indicator reflecting state-level political tendencies to depict the differences in policy orientation and governance environment of different states. It should be emphasized that this variable does not directly represent a specific public health policy, but is only used as a reference in exploratory analysis to compare the policy environment of different states.\n",
        "analytical methods\n",
        "In terms of analysis methods, this project combines descriptive analysis, spatial visualization and exploratory correlation analysis to adapt to the characteristics of data at different levels, and also better meet the needs of the research problem itself. The overall method does not aim to establish a causal relationship, but hopes to identify the characteristics of the obesity rate in spatial distribution through different analytical means, and whether there is a systematic statistical correlation between it and socioeconomic and political variables.\n",
        " At the global and state levels, the analysis is mainly done through descriptive statistics and visualization. By sorting the obesity rate at the national level, the position of the United States in international comparison can be intuitively judged; and the spatial distribution map of the obesity rate at the state level helps to identify whether the obesity problem shows a persistent high trend in a specific region. Such spatial characteristics are often difficult to reflect through a simple numerical table.\n",
        "\n",
        "After completing the state-level distribution analysis, the study further selected the five states with the highest obesity rate as the object of analysis. This approach helps to focus the explanatory analysis in the most prominent areas of the problem, rather than an averaged comparison between all states.\n",
        " For these five states, the study uses the Pearson correlation coefficient to conduct an exploratory analysis of the relationship between the obesity rate and education, economic and political variables. The purpose of correlation analysis is to identify whether there is a statistical correlation between variables, not to judge their causal relationship. Considering that most of the data used are aggregate indicators and the sample size is limited, correlation analysis is more suitable as a preliminary exploration tool than a substitute for complex models.\n",
        " In the specific analysis, draw a scatter plot between the obesity rate and each explanatory variable for each state, and compare the results of different states side by side. This practice helps to observe whether the correlations show similar patterns in different states, or whether there are obvious differences.\n",
        "\n",
        "Limitations of methods and data\n",
        "When interpreting the analysis results, it is necessary to be cautious about the limitations of methods and data. First of all, all analysis is based on aggregate data at the state or county level, so there is a possibility of ecological fallacy. The statistical relationship at the group level does not necessarily reflect the behavioral mechanism at the individual level.\n",
        "Secondly, correlation analysis itself cannot distinguish the causal direction. The relationship between obesity rate and socio-economic variables may be two-way, and may also be affected by other factors that are not included. In addition, political variables have been simplified in the quantitative process, making it difficult to fully reflect the actual complexity of state-level public health policies.\n",
        "Despite these limitations, this study still provides a valuable exploratory perspective for understanding the spatial differences in obesity rates in the United States and their potential social background factors through the combination of multi-level data and multiple analytical methods."

        "Literature Review\n",
        "Obesity has become one of the most urgent public health challenges in the United States. According to the data of the Behavioral Risk Factor Monitoring System (BRFSS), the obesity rate of American adults reached 42.4% in 2024 (Stierman et al., 2021). The southern and Appalachian states - especially West Virginia, Mississippi, Louisiana, Kentucky and Oklahoma - remain among the regions with the highest obesity rates in the United States. This trend shows that obesity should be studied within the framework of the social determinants of obesity.\n",
        "\n",
        "The framework for healthy social determinants is shaped by Marmot (2005) and tCommission on Social Determinants of Health (2008), not just individual choices. This shift in theory is of great significance to the understanding of obesity because it shifts the focus from individual responsibility to structural inequality. Under this framework, socio-economic status, education level and political environment are key determinants of diet patterns, physical activity, health care access and final weight.\n",
        "\n",
        "The relationship between economic conditions and obesity has been widely confirmed. Drewnowski & Specter (2004) put forward the poverty-obesity paradox of developed countries: contrary to intuition, poverty in rich countries does not lead to malnutrition. Another research also shows that the unit calorie cost of fresh agricultural products is 3-5 times that of processed food (Darmon & Drewnowski, 2008), and low-income communities are often food deserts that lack affordable health food retailers (Walker et al., 2010), and the long-term pressure brought about by economic insecurity will disrupt metabolic regulation (Offer et al., 2010). The meta-analysis of 54 studies conducted by McLaren (2007) confirmed that there was a significant negative correlation between the socioeconomic status and obesity rate in developed countries, with an average correlation coefficient of about -0.45.\n",
        "\n",
        "As another core social determinant, the influence mechanism of education is more complex. Cutler and Lleras-Muney (2010) summarised the impact of education on health through three ways in a review published in the journal Economic Outlook: productivity effect (education enhances the ability to understand and apply health information), resource allocation effect (through the impact Occupation and income indirectly affect access to health resources) and time preference effect (education affects people's attention to future returns). A 25-year follow-up study conducted by Cohen et al. (2013) found that the risk of obesity is reduced by about 7% for every year of education, and this effect is still significant after controlling the income factor, indicating that education has a health protection effect independent of economic status. Grossman (2006) believes that education makes individuals more efficient \"healthy producers\".\n",
        "\n",
        "In recent years, political factors have received increasing attention as an emerging dimension of health determinants. Beckfield & Krig (2009) proposed the concept of \"political determinants\" to empharise how policy choices and power distributions systematically affect health outcomes. A study published by Montez et al. (2017) in the American Journal of Public Health quantified policy differences between U.S. states and found that policy variables could explain up to 50% of interstate life expectancy differences. However, a study published by Wasfy et al. (2017) in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that the relationship between political tendencies and health outcomes is very complex: counties with high Trump support in 2016 usually had higher mortality rates. However, the study of Gellman et al. (2024) shows that due to the \"McPerson's paradox\" and demographic effects, the political and health relationship at different geographical levels may be completely opposite.\n",
        "\n",
        "Although the existing literature on social determinants and obesity is quite rich, there is still a lack of systematic comparative research on the high obesity rate in specific regions, and the interaction between economic, educational and political factors is still unclear. This study aims to test the applicability of the social determinant theory in these \"extreme cases\" by analyzing the county-level data of five states with high obesity rates in the United States.\n",
        "\n",
        "Discussion\n",
        "The empirical analysis of this study not only confirms the core predictions of the literature, but also shows important regional differences and theoretical contradictions. Next, it will be explained one by one from the three perspectives of economy, education and politics.\n",
        "\n",
        "The most important finding of the study is that there is a significant negative correlation between the medan household income and the adult obesity rate. This conclusion was verified in all five states analyzed: Mississippi (r = -0.752, n=83), Kentucky (r = -0.689, n=121), Louisiana (r = -0.683, n=65), West Virginia (r = - 0.552, n=56) and Oklahoma (r = -0.510, n=78). This finding is highly consistent with the \"poverty-obesity paradox\" proposed by Drewnowski and Spectre (2004), which directly supports the mechanism by which economic poverty leads to obesity by restricting people's access to healthy food.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, the correlation intensity observed in the data analysis results is generally higher than the average (r ≈ -0.45) reported in the McLaren (2007) meta-analysis. In particular, Mississippi's -0.752 has almost reached the high limit of strong correlation. This difference can be understood from two aspects: first, the impact of extreme cases - the state examined in this study is one of the poorest states in the United States, representing a typical case of \"extreme poverty - extreme obesity\". As Offer et al. (2010) pointed out, the marginal effect of income will be amplified at the level of absolute poverty. As one of the poorest states in the United States, Mississippi has a county-level income of between $30,000 and $70,000 and an obesity rate of more than 32% to 50%, which makes the income effect more significant. Secondly, the advantage of county-level analysis is that county-level data can capture the variability of community factors (such as the local food environment), which are difficult to measure in individual or state-level data (Walker et al., 2010).\n",
        "\n",
        "All states have confirmed a negative correlation between education level and obesity rate, ranging from -0.429 (West Virginia) to -0.655 (Louisiana). This is consistent with the results of a longitudinal study by Cohen et al. (2013), which found that the risk of obesity is reduced by 7% for every year of education. Comparing our data with Cohen's research results, the obesity rate in Louisiana has decreased by about 8 percentage points as the proportion of the population with a college degree increased from 30% to 70%, which is similar.\n",
        "\n",
        "The differences in educational effects between states are worthy of attention. The significant educational effect of Louisiana (r = -0.655) may reflect the mechanism of \"healthy knowledge production\" empharised by Kenkel (1991): in areas with highly differentiated educational resources, the gap in health literacy between educated and uneducated people is greater. On the contrary, the weaker educational effect of West Virginia (r = -0.429) echoes Greenhalgh's (2015) criticism that the marginal effect of education will weaken in areas facing serious structural obstacles to development (such as the economic collapse caused by deindustrialization).\n",
        "\n",
        "The most unexpected finding of this study is that there is an inverse relationship between political tendencies and obesity rates in different states, which is the opposite of the national model reported by Vasfi et al. (2017). In Kentucky (r = +0.451) and West Virginia (r = +0.498), Republican support is positively correlated with obesity, which is consistent with Wasfy's research results. However, Mississippi showed a strong negative correlation (r = -0.789), which means that the higher the Republican support, the lower the obesity rate, which is exactly the opposite of expectations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Given the warning of the Simpson paradox by Gelman et al. (2008), this anomaly is understandable. Mississippi's racial political structure is unique: African-Americans make up 38% of the state's population (the highest in the United States), and race and politics almost completely overlap - the majority of African-American communities support the Democratic Party, while the white community is highly Republican. At the same time, data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that the obesity rate of African Americans (49.6%) is significantly higher than that of whites (42.2%), which stems from historical apartheid and economic discrimination (Williams & Mohammed, 2013). Therefore, at the county level, the obesity rate in counties with high Democratic support (mainly composed of African-American residents) is also high, and there is a statistical negative correlation between the two. It should be noted that this finding reveals a blind spot in the theory of political determinants proposed by Bakerfield and Krieger (2009): using election results to represent the political environment ignores the impact of demographic factors.\n",
        "\n",
        "Reflection\n",
        "Although this study has achieved remarkable empirical results, there are still many methodological and theoretical limitations, which are worth further discussion.\n",
        "\n",
        "The most fundamental limitation lies in the problem of causal inference. The correlation in cross-sectional data is a mixture of causality, inverse causality and common cause. Pearl and Mackenzie (2018) empharised that observational data can only reveal correlation, not causality. Although in theory, income affects food choices, which in turn affects obesity, there may also be a reverse causal relationship: obesity will lead to employment discrimination, thus reducing income. To establish a causal relationship, randomised controlled trials or quasi-experimental design are required, and these methods are often difficult to implement in large-scale population studies.\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition, the county-level summary data may cover up the heterogeneity in the county. Robinson's classic paper (1950) points out that the relevance of the group level cannot be extraported to the individual level. The negative correlation between politics and obesity in Mississippi is a classic case, reflecting the demographic effect rather than the causal relationship at the individual level. Therefore, the aggregate data used in this study may underestimate the real impact of socio-economic status at the individual level. Future research should adopt a multi-layer model and analyze the individual and community levels at the same time.\n",
        "\n",
        "In terms of methodological design, this study adopts a single linear research model, which fails to measure key intermediary paths such as supermarket density and working hours, so it fails to determine the most effective intervention entry point. In addition, this study ignores potential regulatory variables such as community evaluation and local public health inputs, although these variables can explain the differences in obesity rates between counties with similar socioeconomic conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, from a policy perspective, public health interventions often have the color of patriarchal style and ethical judgment (Leichter, 2003). The results of the study may still be misused; for example, the high obesity rate in low-education groups may be interpreted as a lack of self-discipline. Therefore, policies should be based on collective responsibility rather than individual blame, and create a social environment where everyone can flourish. In addition, physiological diversity should be recognised to avoid stigmatising the research results.\n",

Prevalence is highest in a distinct regional cluster encompassing the South and Midwest, with the most extreme obesity rates found in the Deep South.

        "The correlation for Mississippi reveals the strongest economic relationship observed so far. The connection between median household income and obesity is strong (r = -0.752), indicating that lower income is a very powerful predicting tool of higher obesity rates across the state.\n",
        "\n",
        "The relationship between education level and adult obesity rate, while still negative, is more moderate (r = -0.475). This suggests that the percentage of adults with some college education is less consistently tied to obesity outcomes than income is within Mississippi.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, counties with lower median incomes experience significantly worse obesity rates. While higher education still shows a protective association, the catalyst of local disparity appears to be financial resources. This implies that in regions with high baseline poverty, improving economic conditions may be a critical prerequisite for improving public health outcomes like obesity.\n",

        "The correlation analyses for Oklahoma reveal a distinct pattern, where both economic and educational factors show a moderate and almost identical negative relationship with adult obesity rates across its counties. The strength of the correlation for median income (r = -0.510) is virtually the same as for the percentage of adults with some college education (r = -0.513).\n",

        "This indicates that in Oklahoma, lower income and education level contribute to higher local obesity prevalence. Neither socioeconomic factor appears to be a stronger predictor than the other.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, Oklahoma presents a case where economic and educational disadvantages are equally associated with poor health outcomes. Counties with fewer financial resources and lower levels of higher education both tend to experience higher obesity rates. This burden suggests that effective public health interventions in Oklahoma may need to address both financial access to healthy economic and literacy simultaneously to mitigate the obesity epidemic."

        "The correlation analyses for West Virginia, the state with United States’ highest obesity rate, reiterates a clear socioeconomic divide. The data shows a negative correlation between median household income and obesity rate (r = -0.552), indicating that counties with lower incomes tend to have higher obesity prevalence.\n",
        "\n",
        "The relationship with education level is weaker (r = -0.429). This suggests that while counties with a lower percentage of adults having some college education also tend to have higher obesity rates, the connection is not as strong or consistent as it is for income.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, lower county-level income is a significant marker for worse health outcomes. This pattern states that addressing obesity crisis may require interventions that specifically consider the effects of local poverty and limited economic opportunity on community health.\n",

        "Across all states analyzed—Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and West Virginia—a consistent and powerful trend is evident - lower median income and education level are strongly associated with higher adult obesity rates at the county level. The correlation is consistently negative, confirming that socioeconomic disadvantage is a key pusher of health gaps. While the strength of the relationship varies, the trend is similar. This reveals that United States’ adult obesity prevalence is not evenly distributed but is linked to the underlying social and economic inequalities."
